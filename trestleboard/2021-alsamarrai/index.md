# Dr. Lahab Al-Samarrai on Jungian Advanced Motor Processing

![](al-samarrai.jpg#right)
For the first installment of our Esoterika
Lodge Quarterly Public Lecture Series for
2021, we are proud to present Dr. Lahab
Al-Samarrai. Dr. Al-Samarrai is a licensed Clinical
Psychotherapist with a Masters in Clinical Psychology
and PhD in Clinical Psychotherapy. He has been
practicing for over 14 years in residential and
outpatient settings, and is also a clinical supervisor
and university lecturer. Founder of the Institute for
Conflict in Seattle, WA, Dr. Al-samarrai has also
been working with the Jung Institute in Zurich
since 2005, making him somewhat of a pioneer in
bringing contemporary European Jungian treatments
to the United States.

For our lecture series, Dr. Al-Samarrai will be
discussing his use of "Jungian Advanced Motor
Processing," an Archetype-based treatment that
incorporates meditation, movement, hypnosis, and
talk therapy for the healing of psychological illness.
This lecture will be sure to provide incredible
insights into the modern applications of a somewhat
mystical figure in psychotherapy.
