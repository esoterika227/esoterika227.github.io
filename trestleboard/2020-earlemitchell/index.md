# Egyptian Origins of Washington, D.C.: African Gods in America's Capital by Earle Mitchell

This Zoom presentation is a quest to find the
foundations of Africa, specifically from Kemet
(Egypt), as used in the urban planned governmental
cornerstone of America – Washington, Kemetic ideas that
go back in time at least 4,100 years. The ideas shared herein
are based upon the thesis, Understanding Washington, D.C.
through a Kemetic Lens (Completed May 2009). That thesis
sets the foundation for the thoughts shared within the
presentation. Those thoughts shared show that there are
two ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) faces, the gods Asr (Osiris
of the Greek) and Ast (Isis from the Greek) etched in the
urban plan of Washington, D.C. Ultimately, the purpose of
this knowledge is to enlighten and expand the current
narrative as it relates to America’s capital. There are other
contributions to the creation of Washington, D.C.’s urban plan
and this presentation outlines some of those contributions
from an African perspective.

**Earle C. Mitchell, III** is an accomplished mentor and scholar
of African and African-American studies, with deep experience
in the development of collegiate-level mentorship programs
that promote cultural identity and understanding. His various
travels and studies have put Mr. Mitchell and 3rd iMedia in a
position to move cultural thought processes further and allow
the unknown to become known. As information has been
gathered by Mr. Mitchell, books have been and will be created
to capture the journey of Africans and African-Americans.
