The policy of Esoterika Lodge №227 is not one of presumptive
progression through the officer line. Rather, we hold that excellence
in the performance of subordinate offices demonstrates fitness for
higher offices, and that the most appropriate brother should serve in
each station or place. Thereby, we promote order and harmony in the
lodge, and assure that we continue to accomplish our important
mission.
